 <h1 style="color:lime;"><strong>Who was Harambe?</strong></h1>
 
  <h2 style="color:lime;"><strong>  
Harambe  was a western lowland gorilla who lived at the Cincinnati Zoo. On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy visiting the zoo climbed under a fence into an outdoor gorilla enclosure where he was grabbed and dragged by Harambe. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe.</strong></h2>
