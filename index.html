  <h1>Who was harambe?</h1>
  <h2>Harambe  was a western lowland gorilla who lived at the Cincinnati Zoo. On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy visiting the zoo climbed under a fence into an outdoor gorilla enclosure where he was grabbed and dragged by Harambe. Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe.</h2>
